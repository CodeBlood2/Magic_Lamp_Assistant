# Magic_Lamp_Assistant
A simple assistant which makes your wishes come true. Just ask!
Here is my attempt at making an assistant which aims to solve a user's query.It feels like as if the user has found a genie whose sole purpose of existing is completing his master's command!
(P.S. It grants you more than 3 wishes)
The assistant for now has the following abilities:
1)Greet the user according to the specific time(Morning,Afternoon,Evening) 
2)Respond with real-time date and time     (kw: time, date)
3)Search an article on wikipedia and give a summary  (kw:wikipedia)
4)Open a website on chrome     (kw:chrome)
5)logout,restart and shutdown the system   (kw: logout,restart,shutdown)
6)Take notes and remind  (kw:note,remind)
7)Screenshot (kw: capture)
8)CPU Stats (kw:cpu) 
9)Play local Playlist (kw:playlist) 
10)Tell Jokes  (kw:joke)
(where kw=keyword to be included in the query)
